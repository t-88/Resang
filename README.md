# Resang
A Interpreter To calculate total value of restitors on series and parallel.     
Its a solotion for problem in "prob-R wla 1_R.pdf", i solved it with "ast.literal_eval" function. now i want to solve it from scratch using parsing.
-   Resang short for resistor lang 

## Problem 
(10, [20, 30]) => 22.00   
where () means on series and [] means on parallel

## Run
u can run it in two modes: interperted mode by not providing file input   
```
$ python3 resang.py
```
or normal mode where u provide the file input and the program spits out the calculations
```
$ python3 resang.py input.txt
```
